## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **analysis and optimization of a domestic Wi-Fi network**. The objective was to apply technical knowledge gained during the course to a real-world home environment in order to improve wireless performance and coverage.

The analysis was carried out in a 140 m² multi-level house, where signal issues were present in some areas. After identifying critical zones and sources of interference, a Mesh-based Wi-Fi extension solution was designed and implemented.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- **NetSpot v2.16** – for Wi-Fi signal analysis and heatmap generation
- **TP-Link Archer C6** – dual-band router with MU-MIMO and OneMesh support
- **TP-Link OneMesh RE330** – mesh extender for signal extension
- **Acer Aspire A315-58G** – used for survey measurements

---

## 🏠 Environment Description
- House located in Prignano Cilento (SA), Italy
- Analysis limited to the main residential floor
- Physical obstacles and neighboring Wi-Fi networks cause signal degradation
- Includes 2D floor plans and 3D rendering for spatial visualization

## 🔍 Project Phases

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Channel occupation assessment (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz)
- Signal strength mapping using heatmaps
- Signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) evaluation
- Detection of access points and coverage zones

### 2. Optimization Strategy
- Introduction of a TP-Link OneMesh Wi-Fi extender
- Manual selection of optimal channels (CH1 for 2.4 GHz, CH36 for 5 GHz)
- Evaluation of network performance improvements post-optimization

---

## ✅ Key Results
- Stronger signal coverage, especially in previously weak areas (e.g., bedrooms)
- Improved **Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)** due to mesh amplification
- Better signal distribution and reduced channel overlapping
- Demonstrated effectiveness of mesh technology in constrained scenarios
